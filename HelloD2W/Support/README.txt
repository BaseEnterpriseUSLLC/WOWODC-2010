This application is based on the ERModernLook template available at:

http://avendasora.svn.beanstalkapp.com/repository

The ERMoviesLogic.patch.txt is provided as a demonstration of how to 
convert an existing User entity into an ERCoreBusinessLogic 'actor' 
for the purpose of storing persistent user preferences that are used
by ERD2W.

Lots of other documentation is kept inline with the code, in the
documentation section of the rule editor, and in the comments of the
NavigationMenu.plist.
